[The Scale Omnibus](http://www.saxopedia.com/the-scale-omnibus/)
([wayback](https://web.archive.org/web/20200220013047/http://www.saxopedia.com/the-scale-omnibus/))
is a book written by Francesco Balena, which is a catalouge of musical
scales and their intervals. The `scale_omnibus` crate provides this
data in the form of a Rust library.

This library contains YAML data compiled by Corey Hoard: [ioanszilagyi/scale_omnibus](https://github.com/ioanszilagyi/scale_omnibus)

## Features

- More than 1000 musical scales.
- Retrieve scales directly by name.
- Search for scales based on any criteria, such as origin, name
substring match, or the number of intervals.
